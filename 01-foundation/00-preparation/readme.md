## Brief outline and schedule for the three weeks

- **The schedule is optional**, so you don't have to stick to it, but make sure
  to get through it all before the course starts.

### First week - [Computers](materials/computers) and [Internet](materials/internet)

This week, you will learn about the basics of computers, how they connect to one
another, the base principles and functioning of the internet.

### Second week - [Command Line (CLI)](materials/command-line) and [HTML](materials/html)

- The first part of the second week is about the command line interface. At
  first this may seem scary, but you will use it a lot later, so we provide you
  materials and practices to help you become more efficient at using it.
- The second part of this week is about HTML **(2 days)**, which is the basic
  building-block of most webpages.

### Third week - [CSS](materials/css) and [project](project)

- On the third week it's time for CSS **(3 days)**, so your webpages can look
  prettier and more user-friendly.
- The last part of the preparation phase is the project where you will build
  your first webpage. This will be based on this and the previous weeks'
  materials, so be sure to look into those first.
