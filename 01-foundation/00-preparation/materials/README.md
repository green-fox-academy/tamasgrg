# Teaching materials

Videos, articles and mini courses to learn about various basic topics.

## Structure

1. **Review** - A "checklist" of what you should be familiar with after reading
   / watching the materials
1. **Materials** - Videos or articles about the module's topic
1. **Practice** - Small tasks to practice the learnt material - Not all of the
   modules contain this section

## Workflow

1. First read the Review to get an idea of what to focus on during the Materials
   section
1. Then watch/read the materials
1. Afterwards make sure that you are able to explain the Review's keywords
1. Finally complete the tasks in the Practice section (if there is any)

**Don't forget to take notes, you will need them for the project!**
