## Brief outline and schedule for the three weeks

- On this page we want to provide you with a schedule for the three weeks during
  the preparation phase before you start your course at Green Fox Academy.
- These three weeks are meant to prepare you for the course, so you will get new
  materials and smaller practice exercises for every week, and a bigger project
  at the end.
- **The schedule is optional**, so you don't have to stick to it, but make sure
  to get through all of them until the course start.

## First week - [Computers](materials/computers) and [Internet](materials/internet)

In this week you will learn about the basics of computers, their connection to
each other and about the base principles and working of the internet.

## Second week - [Command Line(CLI)](materials/command-line) and [HTML](materials/html)

- The first part of the second week is about the command line interface. At
  first this can seem scary, but you will use it a lot later, so we provide you
  materials and practices, so you can become more efficient using it.
- The second part of this week **(2 days)** is about HTML, which is the basic
  building-block of the webpages.

## Third week - [CSS](materials/css) and [project](project)

- On the third week it's time to CSS, so you can make your webpages look more
  pretty. **(3 days)**
- The last part of the preparation phase is the project, where you will build
  your first webpage. This will be based on this weeks and previous weeks
  materials, so be sure to do those first.
